### Accessing Data With SQL

# Extracting the Data
------

## Write a SQL query below
Use the SQL Workspace below to extract data from the temperatures database, then download the results to a CSV. Then you can open it up in a spreadsheet program in order to analyze it.

## The Database Schema
There are three tables in the database:

- city_list - This contains a list of cities and countries in the database. Look through them in order to find the city nearest to you.
- city_data - This contains the average temperatures for each city by year (ºC).
- global_data - This contains the average global temperatures by year (ºC).
