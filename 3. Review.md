# Review

- **The SQL query used to extract the data is included.**
- **The query runs without error and pulls the intended data.**
> The query is appropriate. It is awesome that when using SELECT, you being specific about the field that you want to extract from the server. That can save space and time, in many cases when the dataset is large.


- **Moving averages are calculated to be used in the line chart.**
  Well Done for calculating the moving average! There is no golden rule about the duration of the moving average. The tradeoff is between more information and how much noise we would like to remove. In this case, since we like to identify similarities but also differences. Therefore, we would like to choose the moving average that will allow us to identify common trends but also differences between the regions.

- **A line chart is included in the submission.**
- **The chart and its axes have titles, and there's a clear legend (if applicable).**
  This is a good chart since it depicts the average temperature for both regions during the same duration. Well done for including clear axis labels, titles and legends.


- **The student includes four observations about their provided data visualization.**
- **The four observations are accurate.**
  The report includes an interesting discussion that summarises the findings and observations from the analysis and the charts. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming
