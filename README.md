## Exploring Weather Trends - Project Instructions

### Summary
------
In this project, you will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

### Instructions
------
Your goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live. To do this, you’ll follow the steps below:

- **Extract the data** from the database. There's a workspace in the next section that is connected to a database. You’ll need to export the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big city to where you live. You can find a list of cities and countries in the city_list table. To interact with the database, you'll need to write a SQL query.
..- Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
..- Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.
